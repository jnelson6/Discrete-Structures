;; In this lab, we're going to define functions with sets tail
;; recursively
;; To make things simpler we are only going to pass in sets as parameters
;; Do not use make-set for these since make-set is not tail-recursive.

;; Define element? tail recursively
;; Given a set s and an element e, determine whether e in s.
;; If an element is found it should instantly return true otherwise
;; it looks at the rest of the set
;;
;; (element?-tco '(0 1 2 3) 0) => #t
;; (element?-tco '() 'a) => #f
;; (element?-tco '(x y z) 'z) => #t

;; Define union-tco (tail recursive union)
;; Given two sets compute the union of the two sets.
;; Order does not matter in this but having duplicate elements is incorrect
;; Add elements to one set while getting rid of elements from the other set

;; Define intersection-tco-help
;; Given two sets and an empty set return the set of all shared elements
;; Order does not matter in this but having duplicate elements is incorrect

;; Final problem: Defining a TCO fibonacci function
;; It takes three arguments, an index and two initializers a, b.
;; The function returns the nth Fibonacci numbers starting at a and b
;; (The general call would be (fib n 0 1)).

;; (fib 0 2 3) => 2
